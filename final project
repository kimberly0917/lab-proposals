# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Alien Invasion

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where you have to defeat aliens by using ships that fire bullets.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use Pygame to create a rocketship that moves and fires bullets in response to the players input. I will create a fleet of aliens to destroy and then continue to refine the game by setting limits on the number of ships a player can use and adding a scoreboard.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish creating a fun little game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish figuring out how Pygame works.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish learning how to code the game correctly. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I first have to install Pygame and create a Pygame window, and set up a background color. I have to create a ship that fires bullets, a ship class and learn to adjust the ships range. I also have to create the aliens in the game. The last step to creating this game would be adding the scoring like the play button and the scoreboard.
